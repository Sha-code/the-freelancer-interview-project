## Intro

Install dependencies with `npm i` then run the devenv with `npm run up`.

If you want to know if everything is running like it should, `npm run log` (you can select a process to log like so: `npm run log api`)

Having some trouble with the codegen ? Run `npm run codegen` and look for errors.

Wanna stop everything ? `npm run down` is here for you.
